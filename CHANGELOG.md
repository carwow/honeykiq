## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support ruby v3

## [1.4.1]
### Fixed
- Expand sidekiq version constraint

## [1.4.0]
### Added
- Support for `:child_trace` mode (#19)

### Fixed
- Support sidekiq v6.2.2 (#23)
- Link events respect beeline sampling (#17)
  WARNING: This is technically a breaking change since it now sends
  `meta.annotation_type` field instead of `meta.span_type` for the link event,
  but `meta.span_type` is deprecated for annotation events since it already has
  another use case which the beeline uses. I believe no one is actually using
  link events anyway. If you run into problems and need help, open an issue.
