# Honeykiq

Sidekiq ‚Üí Honeycomb üêù

Send [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org)-related events to [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'honeykiq'
```

## Usage

The library provides two use cases:

- [`Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware`]
- [`Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter`]

[`Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware`]: #HoneykiqServerMiddleware
[`Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter`]: #HoneykiqPeriodicReporter

### Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware

Add Honeykiq to your Sidekiq server middleware chain, and pass a [`Libhoney::Client`][libhoney] as shown below. It will send an event to Honeycomb once a job finishes or fails.  Have a look at [server_middleware.rb] to see what kind of information we send.

[server_middleware.rb]: https://github.com/carwow/honeykiq/blob/master/lib/honeykiq/server_middleware.rb

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware,
      honey_client: Libhoney::Client.new(
        writekey: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_WRITE_KEY'),
        dataset: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_DATASET')
      )
  end
end
```

You can add your own data or functions to the Honeycomb event by subclassing `Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware`, and overriding the the `extra_fields` method with your own hash. The contents will be serialized into individual items in the event:

```ruby
class MyServerMiddleware < Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware
  def extra_fields
    {
      my_data: 'evaluated and added to the event after the job has finished/errored',
      my_function: -> { Time.now }
    }
  end
end

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add MyServerMiddleware, honey_client: ...
    ...
```

**Note:** If you have long running jobs, an event is only sent to Honeycomb when the job finishes. Therefore, it may appear as though no jobs are currently running.  Additionally, if the process receives a `SIGKILL` then no event is sent about that job, and the job may keep retrying without appearing in Honeycomb. The `PeriodicReporter` should help with this, but we are thinking of a nicer approach.

### Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter

The periodic reporter should be scheduled to report every few seconds, depending on your use case. Every time the `#report` method is called it will send a total of `1 + P + Q` events to Honeycomb where `P` and `Q` are the number of processes and queues respectively.

It sends three types of events: `instance`, `process`, and `queue`. Have a look at [periodic_reporter.rb] to see what kind of information we send for each type.

[periodic_reporter.rb]: https://github.com/carwow/honeykiq/blob/master/lib/honeykiq/periodic_reporter.rb

A setup using [clockwork] to report every 30 seconds would look like this:


```ruby
require 'clockwork'
require 'libhoney'
require 'honeykiq'

module Clockwork
  every(30, 'Honeykiq', thread: true) { SidekiqHealth.report }
end

module SidekiqHealth
  def self.report
    reporter.report
  end

  def self.reporter
    @reporter ||= Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter.new(honey_client: honey_client)
  end

  def self.honey_client
    Libhoney::Client.new(
      writekey: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_WRITE_KEY'),
      dataset: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_DATASET')
    )
  end
end
```
