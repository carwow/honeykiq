# Honeykiq

Sidekiq ‚Üí Honeycomb üêù

Send Sidekiq related events to Honeycomb.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'honeykiq'
```

## Usage

The library provides two use cases:

- [`Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware`]
- [`Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter`]

[`Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware`]: #HoneykiqServerMiddleware
[`Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter`]: #HoneykiqPeriodicReporter

### Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware

Add it to Sidekiq server middleware chain and pass a `Libhoney::Client` as
shown below. It will send an event to Honeycomb once a job finishes or fails.
Have a look at [server_middleware.rb] to see what kind of information we send.

[server_middleware.rb]: https://github.com/carwow/honeykiq/blob/master/lib/honeykiq/server_middleware.rb

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware,
      honey_client: Libhoney::Client.new(
        writekey: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_WRITE_KEY'),
        dataset: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_DATASET')
      )
  end
end
```

#### Adding extra data to events

You can add your own data or functions to the Honeycomb event by subclassing
`Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware` and overriding the the `extra_fields` method with your own
hash. These will be serialized into individual items in the event:

```ruby
class MyServerMiddleware < Honeykiq::ServerMiddleware
  def extra_fields
    {
      my_data: 'evaluated and added to the event after the job has finished/errored',
      my_function: -> { Time.now }
    }
  end
end

Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|
    chain.add MyServerMiddleware, honey_client: ...
    ...
```

**Note on long running jobs:** If you have long running jobs an event is only
sent to Honeycomb when it finishes so it may appear as no jobs are running.
Also if the process gets a SIGKILL then no event is sent about that job and the
job may keep retrying and not appear in Honeycomb. The `PeriodicReporter`
should help with this but we are thinking of a nicer approach.

### Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter

The periodic reporter should be scheduled to report every few seconds depending
on your use case (e.g. 30 seconds). Every time the `#report` method is called
it will send a total of `1 + P + Q` events to Honeycomb where P and Q are the
number of processes and queues respectively.

It sends three types of events: instance, process, and queue.  Have a look at
[periodic_reporter.rb] to see what kind of information we send for each type.

[periodic_reporter.rb]: https://github.com/carwow/honeykiq/blob/master/lib/honeykiq/periodic_reporter.rb

A simple setup using [clockwork] would look like this:

[clockwork]: https://github.com/Rykian/clockwork

```ruby
require 'clockwork'
require 'libhoney'
require 'honeykiq'

module Clockwork
  every(30, 'Honeykiq', thread: true) { SidekiqHealth.report }
end

module SidekiqHealth
  def self.report
    reporter.report
  end

  def self.reporter
    @reporter ||= Honeykiq::PeriodicReporter.new(honey_client: honey_client)
  end

  def self.honey_client
    Libhoney::Client.new(
      writekey: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_WRITE_KEY'),
      dataset: ENV.fetch('HONEYCOMB_DATASET')
    )
  end
end
```
